# CS2 Player Fetcher

CS2 Player Fetcher is a C++ application that retrieves and displays information about Counter-Strike 2 players you've recently played with
(this includes the players in the current match you are in).
It tries to filter the players to ones in your current server.
It uses the Steam API and Leetify API to gather data and present it in a neatly formatted table.

- Fetches recent co-players from Steam
- Retrieves player statistics from Leetify
- Displays information such as Leetify rating, Premier rank, aim/positioning/utility scores, time to damage, crosshair placement, headshot percentage, win rate, matches, and bans
- Provides an option to open Leetify profile links for each player
